Website made to be seen in phone screens sizes.  
A user starts with a empty digital garden plot. They can plant a seed that represents either someone or something they are grateful for.   
This could be anything from a kind gesture from a friend to a beautiful view they witnessed.  
It includes features such as leveling system, plant state that changes over time if not taken care of, a journal with logs for each plant, a little mascot that helps the user, and many other.
