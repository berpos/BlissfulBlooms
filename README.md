A user starts with a empty digital garden plot. Each day, they can plant a seed representing something they are grateful for. 
This could be anything from a kind gesture from a friend to a beautiful view they witnessed.
It includes features such as leveling system, plant state that changes over time if not taken care of, a journal with logs for each plant, a little mascot that helps the user, and many other.
